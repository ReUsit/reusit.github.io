We do this by creating a user-friendly and intuitive platform and bringing back the old time sharing spirit.</p>\n<p>We envision a world where individuals will globally share to anyone through a community, raising collective consciousness and creating social interactions. A world where existing resources will be put forward and re-used instead of creating new ones contributing to a positive impact on the environment. A world where time-banking will have a real value and everyone would be able to bring something to the community.</p>\n<p>Our 2 keys words are Access and Convenience. We simply want that people find what they need when they need. Simply as ! The platform is here  to help people who have different ideas of consumption (using instead of buying), who are keen for social relationships or again have a sensitivity to the impact done on the environment.</p>\n<p>How did the project start : The idea of this platform started a couple of years back now. The first time Sebastien and I met was a starting point of our project. Hereâ€™s the little anecdote : I needed help as 2 CD got stuck in my laptop and I looked for someone online that could bring me a solution. Sebastien really kindly offered me to come to his place and sorted it out by using the right tools. That time I didn't have much to give back...In retrospect, looking back at the situation we both felt it was the right thing to do and wanted to do it more and live more in that way. The idea of this platform naturally emerged from there.</p>"}}}}
