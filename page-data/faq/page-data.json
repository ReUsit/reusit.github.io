All is based on a currency : Toha. Lend objects enables to earn Toha and lend objects costs Toha. Finally, you simply need to participate to enjoy for free.\nWhat does “Toha” mean ?</p>\n<p>As ReUsit is launched in Aotearoa (New-Zealand in maori), we wanted to use a maori word for the currency used. Indeed, Toha comes from “Tohatoha” that means To share.\nWhat is the cost to use ReUsit?\nSubscribing and using BT is free of charge. Nevertheless, ReUsit has a business model by proposing its services to groups of people called communities (fellow-workers in a company, team-mates in a club etc.). By creating a “community”, the group can have access to a private and personalized sharing group. </p>\n<h2 id=\"i-cant-find-what-im-looking-for\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#i-cant-find-what-im-looking-for\" aria-label=\"i cant find what im looking for permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I can’t find what I'm looking for?</h2>\n<p>If you've been looking for a specific object but you can't find one near you, you can add it to your wishlist!
